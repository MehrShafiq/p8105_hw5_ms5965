## Problem 1

Reading in the data.

    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",

    arm_id,
    into = c("arm_id", NA),
    sep = "\\.") %>%

    arm_id,
    into = c("arm", "id"),
    sep = "_") %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "observations",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week))
```

``` r
plot = 
  clean_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observations, group = arm, color = arm)) +
  geom_line() + 
  stat_smooth(aes(group = 1), geom = "point", fun.y = mean, shape = 10, size = 1) +

The experiment group shows an increasing trend while the control group
stays more stable over time.

## Problem 3

``` r
sim_mean_sd = function(n, mean, sd) {
 
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean, sd)
      ) %>% 
    t.test(
      alternative = 'two.sided', 
      paired = FALSE, 
      conf.level = 0.95
      ) %>% 
    broom::tidy()
  
 }
```

For mean = 0

``` r
sim_results = 
    rerun(5000, sim_mean_sd(30, 0, 5)) %>% 
    bind_rows()
```

For all means:

``` r
sim_plot_data =
    tibble(
      mean_list = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mean_list, ~rerun(5000, sim_mean_sd(30, mean = .x, sd = 5))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
    ) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs)
```

### First plot

``` r
plot_A = 
  sim_plot_data %>% 
  group_by(mean_list) %>% 
  summarize(
        reject = sum(p.value <= 0.05),
        count = n()
      ) %>% 
      mutate(
        prop = reject/count
      ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = mean_list, y = prop)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_line() +
    labs(
    title = "Power of the Test", 
    x = "Effect Size", 
    y = "Proportion of rejects"
  ) 
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot_A
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_ms5965_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

As the effect size increases, the proportion of rejects increases (power
increases) - it plateaus at effect sizes of 4, 5 & 6.

### Second Plot

``` r
plot_B = 
  sim_plot_data %>% 
  group_by(mean_list) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_mu = mean(estimate)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_list, y = avg_mu)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    y = "Average Estimates", 
    x = "Effect Size"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot_B
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_ms5965_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
plot_C = 
  sim_plot_data %>% 
  filter(p.value <= 0.05) %>% 
  group_by(mean_list) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_mu = mean(estimate)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_list, y = avg_mu)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Samples for which the null was rejected",
    y = "Average Estimates", 
    x = "Effect Size"
  ) 
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot_C
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_ms5965_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="90%" />

The sample average of μ^ across tests for which the null is rejected
approximately equal to the true value of μ for mu values of 3 or
greater. For smaller values there’s a difference; the average is double
for samples for which the null was rejected.

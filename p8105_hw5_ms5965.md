## Problem 1

Reading in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homocide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()

  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>%

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

The experiment group shows an increasing trend while the control group
stays more stable over time.

## Problem 3

``` r
sim_mean_sd = function(n, mean, sd) {
 
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean, sd)
      ) %>% 
    t.test(
      alternative = 'two.sided', 
      paired = FALSE, 
      conf.level = 0.95
      ) %>% 
    broom::tidy()
  
 }
```

For mean = 0

``` r
sim_results = 
    rerun(5000, sim_mean_sd(30, 0, 5)) %>% 
    bind_rows()
```

For all means:

``` r
sim_plot_data =
    tibble(
      mean_list = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mean_list, ~rerun(5000, sim_mean_sd(30, mean = .x, sd = 5))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
    ) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs)
```

### First plot

``` r
plot_A = 
  sim_plot_data %>% 
  group_by(mean_list) %>% 
  summarize(
        reject = sum(p.value <= 0.05),
        count = n()
      ) %>% 
      mutate(
        prop = reject/count
      ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = mean_list, y = prop)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_line() +
    labs(
    title = "Power of the Test", 
    x = "Effect Size", 
    y = "Proportion of rejects"
  ) 
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot_A
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_ms5965_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

As the effect size increases, the proportion of rejects increases (power
increases) - it plateaus at effect sizes of 4, 5 & 6.

### Second Plot

``` r
plot_B = 
  sim_plot_data %>% 
  group_by(mean_list) %>% 
  
  
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_list, y = estimate)) +
        geom_line() + 
  stat_smooth(aes(group = 1), geom = "point", fun.y = mean, shape = 2, size = 1)
```

    ## Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: fun.y

``` r
plot_B
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

    ## Warning: Computation failed in `stat_smooth()`:
    ## x has insufficient unique values to support 10 knots: reduce k.
